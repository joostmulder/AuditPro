	<p><strong>Using AuditPRO</strong></p>
	<p>The AuditPRO mobile application is designed as a companion to our web solution. The mobile app is your tool for performing the most efficient &amp; effective store audits. When paired with a Bluetooth printer, AuditPRO also gives you the ability to print reports directly after your audit.</p>
	<p>Using AuditPRO for the first time:</p>
	<p>Log in &amp; select a store to audit:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Log in to the application using your email address and password</li>
	<li>Upon login, you will be asked if you&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;Sync to Server&rdquo; (we strongly recommend syncing prior to each new location&rsquo;s audit to ensure your device has the latest inventory information)</li>
	<li>Select &ldquo;Audit Store&rdquo; to find a store to audit. AuditPRO will suggested the nearest location using your device&rsquo;s GPS location</li>
	<li>If you&rsquo;d like to audit a location that is not shown in GPS-based suggestions, you can filter the list using &ldquo;ALL CHAINS&rdquo; at the top of the screen, then sort using the buttons on the bottom:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>GPS will sort the filtered list by nearest location</li>
	<li>LAST STORE sorts in the order of previous audits (not applicable for first-time use)</li>
	<li>NAME sorts alphabetically</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Selecting the store to audit will show you additional details about the store and ask you to confirm with &ldquo;AUDIT THIS STORE&rdquo;</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Begin auditing the store:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Using the attached barcode scanner, scan a UPC</li>
	<li>Enter the Retail Price &amp; Sale Price (if applicable)</li>
	<li>AuditPRO will default that item to &ldquo;IN STOCK&rdquo; (you can change this by clicking)</li>
	<li>If you&rsquo;d like more information about the item, use the (i) button at the top right corner</li>
	<li>After confirming the price &amp; status, use the back-arrow in the top left corner, or scan another item, taking you back to the &ldquo;Select Product&rdquo; screen</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Additional functionality on the &ldquo;Select Product&rdquo; screen:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>NOTES: enter free-form notes to be stores with your audit</li>
	<li>FILTER: hide or display items by status (In-Stock, Void, Out of Stock, none)</li>
	<li>Search Text: search by reorder code, brand, sku, or product name</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Use &ldquo;COMPLETE AUDIT&rdquo; at the bottom of the screen when you&rsquo;ve finished scanning inventory and setting statuses. From this screen, you can PRINT REORDER REPORT and CLOSE OUT AUDIT, which will store the completed audit on your device until the next time you sync.</p>
	<p>Additional Functionality:</p>
	<p>After an audit is complete, you will return to the home screen where you can:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Continue an open audit</li>
	<li>Start a new audit (if one is not currently open)</li>
	<li>Sync to Server (send and receive audit data)</li>
	</ol>
	<p><br /><br /></p>
